# Alfred workflow to use a dict.cc wordbook offline

## Features

* translates in both directions
* translate via keyword
* translate from selected text in OS X via hotkey
* save favorite words (by clicking the translation in Alfred)
* retrieve list of favorite words (using keyword)

## Getting Started

## Configuration

* use config.yaml in this workflow directory
* setup storage/file to a file of your choice (otherwise favoring is inactive), use full path + filename, e.g. /Users/username/vocab.tsv

## Tip

Your favorite translations are stored tab separated in a file of your choice (-> see configuration). You can share it with other apps in order to learn your vocabulary. 

I highly recommend using Flashcards http://flashcardsdeluxe.com/Flashcards/ for iOS for this purpose. It also supports Dropbox Sync. You can point your vocabulary file to a folder in your Dropbox and access it via Flashcards.
